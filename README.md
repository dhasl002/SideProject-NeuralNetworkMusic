# Generating Music with a Neural Network

Loosely inspired by Google's WaveNet, I have created a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In this model, the first layer is visible while the next layer is hidden. For the generative algorithn, I used Gibbs Sampling so that each state in the model is a chord constructed with randomness.
